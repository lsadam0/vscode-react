# Change Log

### 0.2.12
* Remove PropTypes from component snippets.  I mean, we are using Flow, right?  I've left the standalone PropTypes snippets in, as I'm sure there's some edge case that I'm missing

### 0.2.0 

* Update lifecycle method snippets to prompt user for Props & State type
* Correctly populate Props & State types for Component snippets
